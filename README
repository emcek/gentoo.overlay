sjvermeu gentoo.overlay
=======================

This Git-based overlay contains the ebuilds I create myself or that
others have provided on various locations such as Gentoo's bugzilla
environment, but have not reached the main Portage tree. 

Of those ebuilds I created myself are a couple of "meta" packages
that can be seen as a work-around as long as Portage doesn't support
sets.

Feel free to use the ebuilds yourself as well, Gentoo can only become
better from it.
